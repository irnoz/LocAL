## üí° About the Project

On startup users are greated with beautiful logo and a navigation bar. As the soon as the app loads "Get My Location" button will appear on the screen along with previously described items.

In Locations tab LocAL also contains list of all saved locations with a rounded image and a description. from this screen it is possible to delete, mass edit or change contents of any saved item. taping the saved item takes users to new screen where it's possible to edit data associated to the location.

LocAL also displays saved locations on the map with custom pins using MapKit, which users can tap and edit details of that location.
